    abstract = {We consider the problem if a given program satisfies a specified safety property. Interesting programs have infinite state spaces, with inputs ranging over infinite domains, and for these programs the property checking problem is undecidable. Two broad approaches to property checking are  testing  and  verification . Testing tries to find inputs and executions which demonstrate violations of the property. Verification tries to construct a formal proof which shows that all executions of the program satisfy the property. Testing works best when errors are easy to find, but it is often difficult to achieve sufficient coverage for correct programs. On the other hand, verification methods are most successful when proofs are easy to find, but they are often inefficient at discovering errors. We propose a new algorithm, S ynergy , which combines testing and verification. S ynergy  unifies several ideas from the literature, including counterexample-guided model checking, directed testing, and partition refinement.This paper presents a description of the S ynergy  algorithm, its theoretical properties, a comparison with related algorithms, and a prototype implementation called Y ogi .},

@inproceedings{larsonAustin:2003:coverageDetection,
    abstract = {Improperly bounded program inputs present a major class of program defects. In secure applications, these bugs can be exploited by malicious users, allowing them to overwrite buffers and execute harmful code. In this paper, we present a high coverage dynamic technique for detecting software faults caused by improperly bounded program inputs. Our approach is novel in that it retains the advantages of dynamic bug detection, scope and precision; while at the same time, relaxing the requirement that the user specify the input that exposes the bug. To implement our approach, inputs are shadowed by additional state that characterize the allowed bounds of input-derived variables. Program operations and decision points may alter the shadowed state associated with input variables. Potentially hazardous program sites, such as an array references and string functions, are checked against the entire range of values that the user might specify. The approach found several bugs including two high-risk security bugs in a recent version of OpenSSH.},

abstract={ Modern embedded computing systems tend to be heterogeneous in the sense of being composed of subsystems with very different characteristics, which communicate and interact in a variety of ways-synchronous or asynchronous, buffered or unbuffered, etc. Obviously, when designing such systems, a modeling language needs to reflect this heterogeneity. Today's modeling environments usually offer a variant of what we call amorphous heterogeneity to address this problem. This paper argues that modeling systems in this manner leads to unexpected and hard-to-analyze interactions between the communication mechanisms and proposes a more structured approach to heterogeneity, called hierarchical heterogeneity, to solve this problem. It proposes a model structure and semantic framework that support this form of heterogeneity, and discusses the issues arising from heterogeneous component interaction and the desire for component reuse. It introduces the notion of domain polymorphism as a way to address these issues.},
